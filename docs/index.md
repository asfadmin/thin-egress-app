# Thin Egress App
## Purpose of TEA

At the most fundamental level, TEA is intended to be a FULLY Earthdata Cloud (EDC) compliant
application to enable distribution of EOSDIS data from Amazon S3 while ensuring data
providers have all the tools, controls and metrics required for ensuring data distribution
restriction and reporting compliance. TEA Distribution supports only static S3 data, and is
not intended for service-style or dynamic data distribution.

This documentation is intended to support stand-alone TEA deployments, and while it may be a
valuable tool for TEA deployments provisioned through Cumulus, we suggest you visit cumulus
documentation for guidance on using and customizing TEA from within cumulus.
