### TEA Vision

We the **TEA**m strive to create the simplest, most reliable, most feature-rich S3
distribution app. Our intent is not to provide EVERY feature imaginable, but to maintain the
**THIN** core of broadly applicable features. We want to continue to engage the user
community to improve the feature set while staunchly resisting the siren song of feature
bloat and one-off special ponies.

### Principles of TEA design

* Keep it simple - No special ponies!
* Remove unwanted/unused code
* Write *clean* code
* Engage and support the community
* Strive for 10% community provided code base - we ❤️ PR's!
